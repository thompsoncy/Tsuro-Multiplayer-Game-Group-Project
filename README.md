This is my Java final project for my CS 4500 Software Development class taken in fall of 2019. This was a group project with me as team leader. I did this project with Hiu Ching Law, Bochao Shan and Xinru He.

This project is an exploration of using various forms of machine learning to predict  defaults in a real world peer to peer loan dataset. Specifically this project used the Kaggle peer to peer loan dataset and tried to predict defaults based on a variety of factors, as well as using these methods for general analysis of the data.

This project was an implementation of a Tsuro board game where the specifications were expanded and changed with every assignment. By the end of the project we had a fully functioning over the network multiplayer game which can easily be run by starting up a server and a player side driver. See the documentation for further information
